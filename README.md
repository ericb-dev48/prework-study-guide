# UNC coding boot camp prework study guide

## Description

This is a study guide for UNC coding boot camp course pre-work. The aim of this guide is to help students familiarize themselves with the four core topics of this prework: Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built this project to help others on their learning journeys and to document my own learning journey. It should help web development boot camp students (or any students learning web development) to understand how they should begin learning about this field and what the most important topics are. By building this project, I became more familiar with the building blocks of the web -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- and the Git version control system.

## Installation

## Usage

This study guide contains four sections. The sections cover HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Users can refer to the notes within each section to learn more about the given topics. If they would like a suggestion on what to study, they can inspect the web page and access the console. The JavaScript running behind the scenes will randomly suggest a topic for them to study first.

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
